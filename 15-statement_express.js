/*Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.

Statements create side effects to be useful, while expressions are values or execute to values.

Expressions are unique in meaning, while statements are two-sided in execution. For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not.*/
